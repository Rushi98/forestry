[Indian Forestry A Breakthrough Approach (9th Edition)](https://www.amazon.in/Indian-Forestry-Breakthrough-Approach-9th/dp/B0C9QMG8SC/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1696404929&refinements=p_27%3AManikandan+%26+Prabhu&s=books&sr=1-1)

## Topics common to prelims
- Soils, Soil Conservation and Watershed management (Paper 1 section B)
- Environmental Conservation and Biodiversity (Paper 1 section B)
- Forest Ecology and Ethno botany (Paper 2 section B)
- Forest  Legislation (Paper 2 section B )

## Plan
1. Read Manikandan book cover to cover.
2. Google the topics that are not available in Manikandan but have been asked in PYQs.
3. Learn ‘Forest management’ chapter from _Principles and Practice of Silviculture by L.S. Khanna_. It is enough to have basic knowledge without mugging up many formulas.
4.

|Section|UPSC Syllabus topics|Manikandan chapters|Common to environment Syllabus|What  may be done Before Pre/CSM  <br>(leave scientific names, <20hrs )|Specific remarks about chapter|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|P1A|1. Silviculture ‐ General|1|No||Base of full forestry, 1st step in prep|
|P1A|2. Silviculture ‐ systems|2|No||Base of full forestry, 1st step in prep,specific and imp (I will try giving short video after CSM)|
|P1A|3. Silviculture ‐ Mangrove and Cold desert|3|No||--|
|P1A|4. Silviculture of trees|4|No||Be selective, try doing 2-3 spp each day, no need of sleepless nights because option will be provided for such questions in Mains.|
|P1B|1. Agroforestry, Social Forestry, Joint Forest Management and Tribology|5-6|No|Only definitions of terms Agroforestry, Farmforestry, Social forestry, Urban forestry and JFM|generic chapters, try rem sm examples of each concept,  JFM (IMP)|
|P1B|2. Forest Soils, Soil Conservation and Watershed management|7-9|Partly|Biogeochemical cycles (P177), problem soils (P180), ch 9, annex 1|long generic with lesser specific knowledge addition, many aspects already covered in Pre/CSM, no of Qs asked lesser, may be done after main chapters.|
|P1B|3. Environmental Conservation and Biodiversity|10|Yes|Full chapter|almost all topics already covered in Pre/CSM.|
|P1B|4. Tree Improvement and Seed Technology|11|No||Specific and imp chapter, someone from Botany knowledge can be more helpful, only if available|
|P2A|1. Forest Management and Management Systems|12|No||Manikandan not good source, only this chapter can be referred in limited time from Ram Prakash (pdf link in this blog), I will try giving a short video for this chapter after CSM|
|P2A|2. Forest Working Plan|13|No||easy chapter|
|P2A|3. Forest Mensuration and Remote Sensing|14-15|No||ch 14- specific and imp (I will try giving short video after CSM)|

- use flowcharts specifically for agroforestry and general topics
- statistics for forest fires, mangroves, forest produce revenue, soil erosion
- environment related quotes for environment questions
- all Manikandan diagrams - forest mensuration, surveying, grafting, budding
- scientific names - 3-4 for every possible question - trees for acid, alkali soils; trees for drought areas; frost susceptible; trees preferred for social forestry; kinds of diseases; scientific names from forest resource utilization chapter
- make own notes for repeated questions
>Questions were being mixed within every section of both papers. Silviculture takes some time, focus on easier ones- be sure of the easier ones in both papers – i.e., Part B, attempt 2 questions from it, don’t neglect even a single chapter in Part B, If you leave silviculture and cover rest of the topics well i.e., chapters 1,3,4 in Part A, paper 1; In the worst case, you may need to leave 15-20 marks
>However, once you are done with other topics, revise silviculture (Chapter 2) many times, Go through the images of every silvicultural system, gradually you will get hold of this topic too!

**Regarding Silviculture of trees chapter,**

I got an idea which I am not sure if I saw it earlier somewhere.  
I tried to assign a binary number to important tree species that were asked in the exam earlier, D for deciduous, E for Evergreen, If the tree is Fire susceptible I would give it a code 0, else 1; similarly if it is light demander I assign 0 else 1, If it is Drought resistant I assign 0 Else 1, Similarly for Frost susceptible and so on..Based on these 4 Characteristics-**Light, Fire, Frost, Drought,** For every tree, I got a number varying from 0 to 15 which is easy to memorize. I encoded like this

  ![[Pasted image 20231004151315.png]]
  
In the exam, I can decode this and I can write the characteristics of the tree.Also, try to observe patterns in this chapter before you memorize. Ex: **Most of the deciduous trees, Leaf shedding: Dec-Jan, Leaf Flowering: 2 months after (In Spring)**, Try on similar lines for Temperature, Rainfall etc.,
Few important questions like **VAM, Orthodox and recalcitrant seeds, different types of progeny testing and selection as a method of tree improvement, raunkiaer life forms, Shelford’s law of tolerance, Ecological energetics, , genetic gain** etc., are not covered in Manikandan. Here, I am attaching the notes which I hope you people may find it useful.
